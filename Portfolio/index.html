          <p>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Manu Emmanuel, a computer science student with a passion for app development, artificial intelligence, and UI/UX design. I have developed several apps using Android Studio, Flutter, and Firebase, such as a fitness tracker, a music player, and a social media app. I have also learned how to use frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras to implement various AI models, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. I enjoy creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interfaces using tools like Adobe XD, Figma, and Sketch. My goal is to become a proficient app developer and AI engineer who can create innovative and impactful solutions for real-world problems. In my free time, I love to watch movies and sleep.
